# linear-regression-CAPM
 
This project assesses the validity of using the Capital Asset Pricing Model for cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin and Ethereum). It explores the assumptions and derivations assosciated with simple linear regression, as well as the challenges for using linear regression on time series data. One such challenge is that of structural break points in the data. I examine the impact of market volatility in March 2020 on the cryptocurrency CAPM model. I finally comment on the benefits and challenges assosciated with using CAPM to model cryptocurrencies.
